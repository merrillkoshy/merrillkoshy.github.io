        In this journey, I have worked in a small team, a startup, as a
        freelancer (an entrepreneur attempt) and in MNCs. With this varied
        experience, I have doned a lot of caps ranging from being a graphic
        designer, a 3D modeler, the guy who sets up your computer, cables and
        emails to managing the whole department and developing apps used by
        millions with the government!
