        In this journey, I have worked in a small team, a startup, as a
        freelancer (an entrepreneur attempt) and in MNCs - in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³India, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ªUAE &
        ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬Singapore. With this varied experience, I have doned a lot of caps
        ranging from being a graphic designer, a 3D modeler, the guy who sets up
        your computer, cables and emails to managing the whole department and
        developing apps used by millions with the government!
